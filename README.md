## 🔮 Burnout Risk Prediction

The system allows users to input their daily lifestyle and stress-related habits
and instantly predicts their burnout risk category using a trained machine
learning model.

### Input Parameters:
- Study hours per day
- Sleep hours per day
- Screen time (hours)
- Stress level (1–10)
- Caffeine intake (cups per day)
- Productivity score (1–10)

This feature demonstrates how behavioral data can be used in real time
to identify early warning signs of burnout and mental overload among
college students.
